/**
 * Webhooks allow an application to be notified of changes. This is in addition
 * to the ability to fetch those changes directly as
 * [Events](/developers/api-reference/events) - in fact, Webhooks are just a way
 * to receive Events via HTTP POST at the time they occur instead of polling for
 * them. For services accessible via HTTP this is often vastly more convenient,
 * and if events are not too frequent can be significantly more efficient.
 * 
 * In both cases, however, changes are represented as Event objects - refer to
 * the [Events documentation](/developers/api-reference/events) for more
 * information on what data these events contain.
 * 
 * **NOTE:** While Webhooks send arrays of Event objects to their target, the
 * Event objects themselves contain *only IDs*, rather than the actual resource
 * they are referencing. So while a normal event you receive via GET /events
 * would look like this:
 * 
 *     {\
 *       "resource": {\
 *         "id": 1337,\
 *         "name": "My Task"\
 *       },\
 *       "parent": null,\
 *       "created_at": "2013-08-21T18:20:37.972Z",\
 *       "user": {\
 *         "id": 1123,\
 *         "name": "Tom Bizarro"\
 *       },\
 *       "action": "changed",\
 *       "type": "task"\
 *     }
 * 
 * In a Webhook payload you would instead receive this:
 * 
 *     {\
 *       "resource": 1337,\
 *       "parent": null,\
 *       "created_at": "2013-08-21T18:20:37.972Z",\
 *       "user": 1123,\
 *       "action": "changed",\
 *       "type": "task"\
 *     }
 * 
 * Webhooks themselves contain only the information necessary to deliver the
 * events to the desired target as they are generated.
